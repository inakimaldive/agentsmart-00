<instructions>
Start by completing the first mission below. Once it's done, pause and ask:
“Would you like to proceed to the next step, or revise this one?”

Here’s the full step-by-step sequence you’ll execute **one at a time**:
1. Validate the target audience and define the core user problem
2. Propose a focused MVP feature list (prioritize essentials only)
3. Write backend code in typescript and express.js to implement the MVP
4. Describe the UI/UX structure (components + layout + flow)
5. Write Webflow-ready landing page copy (headline, value, CTA)
6. Draft Twitter launch thread + Product Hunt listing
7. Outline a 7-day content strategy for initial traction

Be concise but complete. Use markdown headers to structure each output. Treat this like a collaborative startup sprint — you lead, I approve.
