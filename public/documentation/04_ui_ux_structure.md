# Mission 4: Describe UI/UX Structure

## Overall Design Philosophy

The UI/UX will be designed with a focus on **simplicity, efficiency, and accessibility** for small business owners who may not be highly technical. The goal is to make powerful AI automation tools feel intuitive and manageable. Key principles include:

*   **Clarity:** Easy-to-understand labels, clear calls to action.
*   **Efficiency:** Streamlined workflows to minimize user effort.

*   **Scalability:** A modular design that can accommodate future feature additions.

## Key Sections and Pages

1.  **Authentication Flow:**
    *   **Login Page:** Simple form for email and password.

    *   **Password Reset:** Standard flow for forgotten passwords.

2.  **Dashboard (Home):**
    *   **Purpose:** Central hub providing an overview of the system's status and quick access to core functionalities.
    *   **Content:**
        *   Summary of recent intelligence gathered (e.g., "3 new trends identified").
        *   Status of recent content generation tasks.
        *   Quick links to "Add Data Source", "Generate Content", "View Tasks".
        *   A feed of the latest summarized intelligence.

            *   Option to edit or remove sources.
        *   **Intelligence Feed:**
            *   Display of summarized intelligence from configured sources.
            *   Filtering and sorting options (by source, date, keywords).
            *   Basic trend visualization (e.g., a simple graph showing frequency of a keyword).

4.  **Content Generation Module:**
    *   **Purpose:** Create and manage AI-generated content.
    *   **Sub-sections:**
        *   **Create Content:**
            *   Form with fields for: Topic, Tone (e.g., professional, casual, informative), Content Type (e.g., Social Media Post, Blog Outline), Keywords.
            *   "Generate" button.

            *   Basic editing tools for the draft.
        *   **Content Library:**
            *   A repository of all generated content, sortable and searchable.

    *   **Sub-sections:**
        *   **Task Scheduler:**
            *   Interface to create new automated tasks (e.g., "Fetch RSS feed X daily and summarize").
            *   List of active and completed tasks.
            *   Status indicators.

## Core UI Components

*   **Navigation Bar:** Persistent header with links to Dashboard, BI, Content Generation, Tasks, and User Settings.
*   **Card Components:** Used throughout the dashboard and module views to display summaries, intelligence snippets, and content previews.
*   **Forms:** Standard input fields, text areas, dropdowns, toggles, and date/time pickers for data entry and configuration.
*   **Data Tables/Lists:** For displaying lists of data sources, generated content, and task logs, with sorting and filtering capabilities.
*   **Modals:** For quick actions like adding a new data source or confirming deletions.
*   **Simple Charts:** Basic visualizations (e.g., line or bar charts) for trend analysis in the BI module.

## Example User Flow: Generating a Social Media Post

1.  User logs in and lands on the **Dashboard**.
2.  User clicks "Content Generation" in the navigation bar.
3.  In the "Create Content" section, the user fills out the form:
    *   Topic: "AI in Small Business"
    *   Tone: "Informative"
    *   Content Type: "Social Media Post"
    *   Keywords: "AI, automation, small business, efficiency"
4.  User clicks "Generate".
5.  The system processes the request, and a preview of the AI-generated social media post appears.
6.  The user can then edit the draft or save it to the Content Library.

This structure provides a clear path for users to leverage the AI automation capabilities for their business needs.
