# Mission 1: Validate Target Audience and Define Core User Problem

## Target Audience

Small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) that are:
*   **Time-constrained:** Business owners and teams are often stretched thin, handling multiple roles.
*   **Resource-limited:** May not have dedicated departments for business intelligence or content creation.
*   **Seeking efficiency:** Looking for ways to automate repetitive tasks and improve operational effectiveness.
*   **Interested in AI:** Open to leveraging new technologies to gain a competitive edge.
*   **Struggling with data:** Difficulty in gathering, analyzing, and acting upon business intelligence.
*   **Content-challenged:** Need a consistent flow of marketing, sales, or operational content but lack the bandwidth to produce it.

## Core User Problem

Small businesses often face significant challenges in **efficiently gathering and synthesizing business intelligence** and **consistently generating relevant, high-quality content**. This leads to:
*   **Missed market insights:** Inability to keep up with industry trends, competitor activities, and customer needs.
*   **Inefficient operations:** Manual processes for data collection and analysis are time-consuming and error-prone.
*   **Stagnant growth:** Lack of compelling content hinders marketing efforts, lead generation, and customer engagement.
*   **Competitive disadvantage:** Falling behind competitors who are more adept at leveraging data and content.
*   **Wasted resources:** Time and money spent on manual, often ineffective, intelligence gathering and content creation.

# Mission 3: Backend Code Implementation (TypeScript/Express.js)

This section documents the backend code developed for the MVP of the AI Business Automation SaaS.

## Project Setup Files:

*   **`package.json`**: Defines project metadata, scripts, and dependencies. Key dependencies include `express`, `cors`, `rss-parser`, `typescript`, `ts-node`, and `nodemon`.
*   **`tsconfig.json`**: Configures the TypeScript compiler, specifying target ECMAScript version, module system, output directory, and other compiler options.

## `src/server.ts` (Main Server File):

This file sets up the Express.js server with TypeScript, including middleware and placeholder API routes for core MVP functionalities.

```typescript
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import cors from 'cors'; // Often useful for frontend interaction
import Parser, { Item } from 'rss-parser'; // For RSS feed parsing

// Initialize Express app
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Middleware
app.use(cors()); // Enable CORS for all origins
app.use(express.json()); // Parse JSON request bodies

// --- Placeholder Routes ---

// Root route for health check
app.get('/', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.send('AgentSmart Backend is running!');
});

// Placeholder for User Authentication
app.post('/api/auth/login', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { email, password } = req.body;
  // In a real application, you would:
  // 1. Validate email and password.
  // 2. Check against a user database.
  // 3. Generate and return a JWT or session token.
  console.log(`Login attempt: Email=${email}, Password=${password}`);
  if (email === 'test@example.com' && password === 'password123') {
    res.status(200).json({ message: 'Login successful (placeholder)', token: 'fake-jwt-token' });
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials (placeholder)' });
  }
});

// Placeholder for RSS Feed Intelligence Gathering and Summarization
app.post('/api/intelligence/rss-feed', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { feedUrl } = req.body;

  if (!feedUrl) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'RSS feed URL is required.' });
  }

  const parser = new Parser();
  try {
    const feed = await parser.parseURL(feedUrl);
    console.log(`Successfully parsed RSS feed from: ${feedUrl}`);

    // Basic summarization logic (placeholder)
    // In a real scenario, this would involve AI to summarize feed content
    const summaries: Item[] = feed.items.slice(0, 5).map((item: Item) => ({
      title: item.title,
      link: item.link,
      // Placeholder for AI-generated summary
      summary: `AI summary of: ${item.title || 'No title'}...`
    }));

    res.status(200).json({
      feedTitle: feed.title,
      feedDescription: feed.description,
      latestItems: summaries
    });

  } catch (error: any) {
    console.error(`Error processing RSS feed ${feedUrl}:`, error.message);
    res.status(500).json({ message: 'Failed to process RSS feed.', error: error.message });
  }
});

// Placeholder for AI Content Generation (e.g., Social Media Post Outline)
app.post('/api/content/generate-social-post', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const { topic, tone, keywords } = req.body;

  if (!topic) {
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Topic is required for content generation.' });
  }

  // Placeholder for AI content generation
  // In a real scenario, this would call an AI model with the provided parameters
  const generatedContent = `
    AI-generated draft for a social media post on "${topic}"
    Tone: ${tone || 'neutral'}
    Keywords: ${keywords ? keywords.join(', ') : 'none'}

    ---
    Draft Content:
    [Placeholder for AI generated social media post content based on topic, tone, and keywords.]
    ---
  `;

  res.status(200).json({
    generatedContent: generatedContent.trim(),
    message: 'Social media post draft generated (placeholder).'
  });
});


// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

**Key Features Implemented:**
*   Basic Express server setup.
*   CORS and JSON middleware.
*   Health check endpoint.
*   Placeholder login endpoint for authentication.
*   Placeholder endpoint for RSS feed processing and summarization.
*   Placeholder endpoint for AI content generation (social media post outline).

**Next Steps for Backend:**
*   Implement actual AI integrations for summarization and content generation.
*   Develop a robust user authentication system (e.g., JWT, OAuth).
*   Implement database integration for storing user data, intelligence, and generated content.
*   Add more sophisticated error handling and logging.
*   Implement the task scheduling mechanism.

*   **Modals:** For quick actions like adding a new data source or confirming deletions.
*   **Simple Charts:** Basic visualizations (e.g., line or bar charts) for trend analysis in the BI module.

## Example User Flow: Generating a Social Media Post

1.  User logs in and lands on the **Dashboard**.
2.  User clicks "Content Generation" in the navigation bar.
3.  In the "Create Content" section, the user fills out the form:
    *   Topic: "AI in Small Business"
    *   Tone: "Informative"
    *   Content Type: "Social Media Post"
